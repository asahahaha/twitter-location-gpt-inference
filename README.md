# You Are At Where You Tweet: GPT Prompting to Geo-locate Twitter Users

This work is inspired by work done by Staab et. al from ETH Zurich: [BEYOND MEMORIZATION: VIOLATING PRIVACY VIA INFERENCE WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07298)

## Abstract
Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed to deduce geolocations from social media content, yet their accuracy and implications for privacy remain underexplored. This research utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to predict users' cities of residence from Twitter texts, assessing model efficacy across different geographies. Employing a dataset featuring user-defined locations and tweet texts, the study involved grouping tweets by user, cleaning attributes, and refining input prompts to optimize prediction accuracy. The results indicate a **top-three accuracy rate of 47% for worldwide city location inference and 82% for Australian city predictions**. This investigation underscores LLMs' potential and ethical concerns in geospatial analysis, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of privacy in geolocation inference.
